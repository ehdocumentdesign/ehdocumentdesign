- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehdocumentdesign
- 👀 My tech interests come from my hobbies. I'm primarily a musician. I created **A&R.local** to have a self-hosted content publishing tool. **MUWU** is an authorship/composition tool that sprung from my frustration with word processors.
- 🦶 I follow **projectM** because it's an awesome visualizer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build from code on Linux.
- 💞️ I’m not actively looking to collaborate, but please let me know if find value from any of the repos I host. They're functional but subject to rapid evolution. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
